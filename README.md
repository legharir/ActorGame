# ActorGame
An android application that can show the connection between any two top 5000 actors. Actor and movie data was taken from a kaggle dataset. Vertices of an undirected graph were used to represent the actors and the edges between them movies. Breadth first search was used to find the shortest path between two actors, and the tmdb api was used to retrieve actor images.
